This project implements a Library Catalog Management System in Python that allows managing books, movies, periodicals, and articles. The system stores the catalog in a CSV file and supports reading from and writing to the file. It is designed using an object-oriented approach.
The system can:
Read the catalog from a CSV file
Display books, movies, periodicals, and articles
Add new items (books, movies, periodicals, articles)
Save the catalog back to the CSV file
